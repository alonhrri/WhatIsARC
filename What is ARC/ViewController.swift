// ARC = Automatic Reference Counting - this is Apple's way of handling memory managment of objects for you. for each object it is keeping count of how many strong references are poiniting for that object.

//Example:
//to remove a reference poinitng to an object all we need to do is to set it to nil and the closure deinit will be called.
//it will be called only if the refernce is weak!!!
//but if it is a strong reference - deinit wont be called... try and ARC Count will not count down by 1
